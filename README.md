## Project Vetrina

This is a simple dashboard built with React, it's meant to test my understanding of some new technology I learnt. These include:

1. Typescript.
1. Material UI.
1. React Testing Library.


You can test out the application by cloning this repo and downloading the necessary dependencies by running

### `npm install`

Then start up the server with
### `npm start`

You can also run the test suite with
### `npm test`
